            <img src="frannie.jpg" alt="Franny" width="200">
            <p><strong>Race:</strong> Changeling, <strong>Class:</strong> Bard</p>
            <p>Originally destined to inherit the Ballad Weapons Trading Company, 
                Franziska is a changeling tasked with replacing the company’s original 
                heir. Unaware of her initial failure to kidnap the rightful daughter, 
                she only learned of it years later, when the campaign began. By then, 
                her resolve had shifted—Franziska no longer wished to deliver the child 
                and sought instead to protect her, driven by guilt and fear of the child’s 
                potential wrath. When the time came for the party—Franziska, Kelne, Aldous, Zofhime, 
                and the child—to return home through a portal to the Prime Material Plane, 
                her fey superiors intervened. Manipulating the portal, they forcibly took the 
                child and Kelne into the fey realm instead, leaving Franziska with unanswered 
                questions, a heavy conscience, and the weight of decisions she had little power 
                to change. Even now, the consequences of that fateful moment continue to shape her journey.</p>

            <h3>Zofhime</h3>
            <img src="Zofhime.PNG" alt="Zofhime" width="200">
            <p><strong>Race:</strong> Aasimar, <strong>Class:</strong> Artificer/Warlock</p>
            <p>Zofhime, a natural prodigy in potion-making, grew up in a humble southern Aurian village, 
                where he became a vital resource for crafting remedies and tonics. 
                His talent followed him into his adventuring party, where he 
                often took the lead—though not always successfully. Over time, 
                he transformed from relying heavily on his patron’s guidance 
                to becoming a self-reliant individual, earning his patron’s respect 
                along the way. During a shared dream conjured by 
                Endelyn Moongrave, the Dame of Unhappy Endings, Zofhime witnessed 
                the tragic death of Torin, a figure from his past. While the memory 
                lingers, shaping his resolve, the full story of Zofhime’s growth remains 
                intertwined with the secrets he keeps. </p>

            <h3>Aldous Caesar</h3>
            <img src="Aldous.png" alt="Aldous Caesar" width="200">
            <p><strong>Race:</strong> Half-Elf, <strong>Class:</strong> Bard/Sorcerer</p>
            <p>Aldous Caesar, a consummate conman, has spent most of his life evading 
                just about everything: the law, responsibility, the touch of a woman. 
                His chaotic and unpredictable nature has often worked to his advantage, 
                especially when it comes to lining his pockets. But could there be a reason
                behind the madness? Aldous guards his past like a fortress, steering clear 
                of any conversation that might reveal it. The only glimpse into his history 
                surfaced during a tormenting dream—a surreal experience conjured by Endelyn Moongrave, 
                the Dame of Unhappy Endings. The party, unaware they were trapped in a dreamscape, 
                encountered Dizzy—a woman from Aldous’s past whose sudden appearance was attributed 
                to fey magic. In a haunting twist, Dizzy met her demise within the dream, casting a 
                shadow of grief and mystery over her connection to Aldous. What secrets lie hidden in 
                Aldous's peculiar past? Only time will tell how his strange history shapes the man behind the mask.</p>

            <h3>Quinn</h3>
            <img src="quinn.jpeg" alt="Quinn" width="200">
            <p><strong>Race:</strong> Human, <strong>Class:</strong> Fighter/Ranger</p>
            <p>Quinn, a newcomer to the party, joined in the aftermath of the chaotic and 
                bewildering loss of Kelne and the child during the group’s return to the 
                Prime Material Plane from the Feywild. Wielding a perilous weapon known as 
                'Experiment 42,' she quickly became a focal point of the party's attention, 
                particularly after they glimpsed a vision foretelling a future of catastrophic 
                destruction. It was later revealed that Quinn is on the run from Harion after 
                sabotaging a top-secret testing facility for the Ballad Company, where she had 
                worked as an engineer. Her actions were driven by the discovery of plans for a 
                looming war between Valios and Toleria, with Harion acting as a weapons supplier to 
                Valios. With her family—miners employed by the Ballad Company—potentially at risk, 
                and shadowy forces likely pursuing her, Quinn’s presence brings both uncertainty and 
                danger to the party’s journey.</p>
